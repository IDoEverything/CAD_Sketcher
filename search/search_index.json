A constraint can usually be created between diffrent entity types, check the corresponding operator's tooltip to find out what's supported. Active A constraint is considered to be active when the sketch it belongs to is set as the active sketch or, for constraints that don't belong to a sketch, when no sketch is active. Failure Whenever the solver fails to find a solution for the given system it will try to mark constraints that are causing the failure. Those constraints will be colored red, additionally the failed sketch will be marked. Types Constraint types follow the implementation of solvespace . Geometric Constraints SlvsCoincident Forces two points to be coincident, or a point to lie on a curve, or a point to lie on a plane. The point-coincident constraint is available in both 3d and projected versions. The 3d point-coincident constraint restricts three degrees of freedom; the projected version restricts only two. If two points are drawn in a workplane, and then constrained coincident in 3d, then an error will result\u2013they are already coincident in one dimension (the dimension normal to the plane), so the third constraint equation is redundant. SlvsVertical Forces a line segment to be vertical. It applies in 2D Space only because the meaning of horizontal or vertical is defined by the workplane. SlvsHorizontal Forces a line segment to be horizontal. It applies in 2D Space only because the meaning of horizontal or vertical is defined by the workplane. Note: It\u2019s good to use horizontal and vertical constraints whenever possible. These constraints are very simple to solve, and will not lead to convergence problems. Whenever possible, define the workplanes so that lines are horizontal and vertical within those workplanes. SlvsParallel Forces two lines to be parallel. Applies only in 2D. SlvsPerpendicular Forces two lines to be perpendicular, applies only in 2D. This constraint is equivalent to an angle constraint for ninety degrees. SlvsEqual Forces two lengths, or radiuses to be equal. If a line and an arc of a circle are selected, then the length of the line is forced equal to the length (not the radius) of the arc. SlvsTangent Forces two curves (arc/circle) or a curve and a line to be tangent. SlvsMidpoint Forces a point to lie on the midpoint of a line. SlvsRatio Defines the ratio between the lengths of two line segments. The order matters; the ratio is defined as length of entity1 : length of entity2. Dimensional Constraints SlvsDistance Sets the distance between a point and some other entity (point/line/Workplane). SlvsDiameter Sets the diameter of an arc or a circle. SlvsAngle Sets the angle between two lines, applies in 2D only. The constraint's setting can be used to to constrain the supplementary angle.","title":"Constraints"},{"location":"constraints/#active","text":"A constraint is considered to be active when the sketch it belongs to is set as the active sketch or, for constraints that don't belong to a sketch, when no sketch is active.","title":"Active"},{"location":"constraints/#failure","text":"Whenever the solver fails to find a solution for the given system it will try to mark constraints that are causing the failure.

They differ from regular blender mesh or curve elements which means native blender tools aren't able to interact with it as long as they aren't converted. See the chapter integration for further details on how to process addon specific geometry. Entities are defined by a set of parameters and pointers to other entities which are editable at any point in time. This allows non-destructive workflows and also ensures that geometry is resolution independent. A curve will always follow a given radius no matter how it's transformed. Entities can be created with the various Workspacetools . Active An entity is considered to be active when the sketch it belongs to is set as the active sketch or, for 3D entities, when no sketch is active. Visibility Entities can be hidden. Access the setting from the entity's context menu or from the entity browser . Construction Entities have a construction parameter which can be set via the entity's context menu . If it's set to true the entity will be ignored when converting the geometry however it's still used to solve the geometric system. It's generally good practice to mark entities as construction if they're not part of the final geometry. Fixed Entities can be fixed via the entity's context menu . A fixed entity won't have any degrees of freedom and therefor cannot be adjusted by the solver. It's good practice to base geomtery on a fixed origin point. Warning: While this currently applies to all entities it's intended to be used with points only. Types There are different types of entities, some of them apply in 2 dimensional space which requires a sketch as a parameter. Entity types follow the implementation of solvespace . Only 2D entities can be converted later, check the chapter integration for details. SlvsPoint3D Representation of a point in 3D Space.

So in order to further process drawn shapes they have to be converted to a native type first. INFO: There are some limitations to keep in mind when converting. Convert Types When a sketch is active you can choose the convert type for it in the sidebar. By default this is set to None which means no native geometry will be created. INFO: Setting this to something other than None will disable the visibility of the sketch so that it will only show when it's active Bezier Converter Converts the sketch to a bezier curve. Mesh Converter Converts the sketch to a mesh. This doesn't convert to mesh directly but rather uses the bezier converter and the native to_mesh() function behind the scene. Fill Shape Some converters support the Fill Shape setting. When this isn't set the resulting geometry won't have surfaces at all but rather just edges. INFO: The setting toggles the bezier's fill_mode option between None and Front Limitations 3D Geometry Conversion requires a sketch, the addon currently doesn't support creating 3D sketches and is therefor limited to the conversion of 2D entities. Non-Persistent Geometry The output geometry will be re-generated each time a sketch is deactivated. Converters don't take any modifications that are done after the conversion into account. INFO: Indices of created geometry elements aren't persistent. Referencing such elements isn't currently supported. In order to further process geometry after the conversion make sure you do this in a procedural way, otherwise things might break when editing the sketch. Path Connections Converters parse the geometry depending on shared start-/endpoints, connections created with coincident constraints or overlaps between entities aren't interpreted as a connection. Best Practices To avoid running into such limitations try to follow these practices: Connect entities by sharing a start-/endpoint, avoid using the coincident constraint to connect entities that are part of a path that you intend to later convert. Use the construction option whenever you create geometry that you don't intend to convert. If you have alot of construction geometry create a dedicated sketch that is used for construction only. Then create another sketch on the same workplane and reference entities from the construction sketch. If the Fill Shape option is set make sure the drawn shape is a closed path and that multiple closed paths don't overlap each other.","title":"Integration"},{"location":"integration/#convert-types","text":"When a sketch is active you can choose the convert type for it in the sidebar.

Addon tools usually work on one specific entity or between a few entities where the order of selection matters. As the existing system of selection isn't ideal in this context the addon defines a generic interaction system which allows for a powerful and flexible workflow. Stateful Operations Most tools in the addon are implemented as stateful tools. In this context a state represents one target like a selection or a value. When running a tool you will iterate through these states until all states have valid input. Let's take the \"Add Circle\" tool as an example. Since a circle is represented by it's center and radius the tool will have two states. One to define the center element and one to set the radius. State Types A state can have two different kind of targets: Pointer A pointer target is best described as a selection. Pointer states will prompt the user to select an element of the according type. Property A property target simply represents a value of some kind like an integer or a float or a set of values to represent something like a location. A state can however define both of those targets. In that case the property will be used to create a new element to satisfy the pointer target. This is often used to be able to place a new point at the mouse location when nothing is hovered but pick an existing point if one is hovered. Selection vs Action To be as flexible as possible the interaction system allows to work in different paradigms which can also be freely mixed. Those are: Select -> Invoke Operation (The standard way to work in blender) Invoke Operation -> Select Partial Select -> Invoke Operation -> Select rest (Or set Parameters) Numerical Edit In order to precisely edit a states property it's possible to edit values directly by entering numbers. When the stateproperty is a set of multiple values (e.g. XYZ Location) they will be treated as sub-states, meaning you can iterate (TAB) through them and enter values sequentially. Description When learning how a new tool works it's best to take a look at it's tooltip, this will list the different states of the tool. For pointer states this will additionally display the accepted types that can be picked. While running an operation the statusbar will display that information for the currently active state.
